<h1>SocialLearn</h1>

<p>To integrate Cohere with SocialLearn, you must first set up a 
<a href="http://sociallearnproject.org/" target="_blank">SocialLearn user account</a>.
</p>

<p>Add your SocialLearn username to your Cohere profile</p>

<p>Then whenever you create or edit an idea, you'll have the option of creating a 
SocialLearn goal out of the idea.</p>
